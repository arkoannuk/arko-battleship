# Battleship Game
[https://arko-battleship.netlify.app/](https://arko-battleship.netlify.app/)
## Introduction
This is an implementation of the classic Battleship game, using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. Players can engage in battles against the computer.
## Purpose
I built this project to familiarize myself with the concept of Test Driven Development. By applying TDD, I prioritized writing unit tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of the implemented code. I made use of factory functions, encapsulating the creation of Ship, Gameboard, and Player objects, thus promoting reusability and enhancing the overall structure of the code. All this made the concept around object-oriented programming really "click" with me.
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jest (for testing)
